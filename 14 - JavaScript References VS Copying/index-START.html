      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const playersCopyUsingSlice = players.slice();
      console.log(playersCopyUsingSlice);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const playersCopyUsingConcat2 = [].concat(players);
      console.log(playersCopyUsingConcat);

      const person = {
        name: "Alex",
        age: 26,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const personCopy = person;
      // personCopy.age = 27;
      // console.log(personCopy);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const objectCopy = Object.assign({}, person, { province: "Cavite" });
      console.log(objectCopy);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
